## 🚀 Features  
- 🧠 **On-device AI** – Runs inference directly on edge devices (Jetson, Raspberry Pi, Intel NCS, etc.)  
- 🎥 **Real-time video processing** – Detects and tracks objects such as people, vehicles, or suspicious activity  
- 🔔 **Event-based notifications** – Motion detection, intrusion alerts, or custom triggers  
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** – Video data stays local; only metadata or alerts are shared  
- ⚡ **Optimized performance** – Supports TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile, and ONNX runtime
